# Dune Awakening ESP – X-Ray Vision for Total Desert Domination 🌵🎯

**Dune: Awakening** is chaos. PvP ambushes. Loot snatchers. AI patrols. Base raiders. You can die in a second if you’re not two steps ahead — but with the **ESP mod**, you’ll see *everything* before it sees you. 💡

The **Dune Awakening ESP (Extra Sensory Perception)** is a visual cheat overlay that shows enemies, loot, NPCs, traps, mining nodes, and even base structures **through walls, terrain, and fog**. It turns you from a vulnerable survivor into a desert tactician with full map control.
